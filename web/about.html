            <p>stuyCTF is an online jeopardy-style Capture the Flag competition where the objective is to solve problems to obtain "flags." Featuring problems that range from Binary and Web Exploitations to Reverse Engineering, Forensics, and Reconnaissance, stuyCTF is the ultimate high school CTF competition to get both new and veteran competitors excited about computer science and security. It serves as an excellent hands-on experience that is both rewarding and fun!

            <p>Each team consists of 1-5 students who will work together to solve challenges. The final rankings will be decided on the basis of whichever team obtains the most points, where ties are settled in favor of the team that obtained the points first.</p>
