            <h2>What is stuyCTF?</h2>
            stuyCTF is a capture-the-flag competition designed and built by
            Stuyvesant High School Students for high schoolers in general. This
            is inspired by various other competitions such as <a
            href="https://www.easyctf.com">EasyCTF</a>, <a
            href="https://www.hsctf.com">HSCTF</a> etc. The competition is
            designed to introduce high schoolers (especially Stuyvesant
            students) to hacking and other cyber security fields. For more
            information about the general idea of ctf's and this competition,
            please refer to our <a href="/faq">FAQ</a> page.
