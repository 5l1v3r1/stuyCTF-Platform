Before the competition starts, we would like to share with you one of our example reconnaissance problems. Currently, there is a dinosaur roaming around the internet talking about stuyCTF. Can you find the flag that it is holding?

<form class="form-inline" onsubmit="if($('#flag-input').val()=='stuyctf{googl3_m3m3$}'){alert('Correct! We hope to see you when the competition starts! :)');}else{alert('Sorry... that does not seem correct :(');}return false;">
    <div class="form-group">
        <label class="sr-only" for="flag-input">Enter the flag here</label>
        <input type="text" class="form-control" id="flag-input" style="display:inline-block;width:200px;">
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Check flag!</button>
    </div>
</form>
