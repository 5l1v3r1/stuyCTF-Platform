title: More Problems
---

You might have noticed that we've been slowly releasing new problems as the competition went on (or you just unlocked problems after solving a few). Either way, we hope that you've been enjoying solving each and every one of these problems! Some may take longer than others, but it's up to you to find the best possible solution and to obtain the flag!

We are still in the process of releasing new problems, but we intend to stop after tomorrow (April 16) to give you enough time to solve them all. Remember that the [chat](/chat) is a very helpful place! However, it is **not** a place to share flags. Sharing flags is strictly not allowed. We want you all to experience solving these problems individually and it's not really a learning experience if you cheat!
